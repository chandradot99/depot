Product.create!(title: 'In Search of Lost Time by Marcel Proust',
  description: 
    %{<p>
      Swann's Way, the first part of A la recherche de temps perdu, Marcel Proust's seven-part cycle, 
      was published in 1913. In it, Proust introduces the themes that run through the entire work. 
      The narrator recalls his childhood, aided by the famous madeleine; and describes M. Swann's passion
      for Odette. The work is incomparable. Edmund Wilson said "[Proust] has supplied 
      for the first time in literature an equivalent in the full scale for the new theory of modern physics."

      Ulysses chronicles the passage of Leopold Bloom through Dublin during an ordinary day, June 16, 1904.

Product.create!(title: 'Moby Dick by Herman Melville',
  description: 
    %{<p>
      First published in 1851, Melville's masterpiece is, in Elizabeth Hardwick's words, "the greatest novel
      in American literature." The saga of Captain Ahab and his monomaniacal pursuit of the white whale 
      remains a peerless adventure story but one full of mythic grandeur, poetic majesty, and symbolic power.
      Filtered through the consciousness of the novel's narrator, Ishmael, Moby-Dick draws us into a universe
      full of fascinating characters and stories, from the noble cannibal Queequeg to the natural history of
      whales,while reaching existential depths that excite debate and contemplation to this day.

Product.create!(title: 'Hamlet by William Shakespeare',
  description: 
    %{<p>
      The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, or more simply Hamlet, is a tragedy by William Shakespeare,
      believed to have been written between 1599 and 1601. The play, set in Denmark, recounts how Prince
      Hamlet exacts revenge on his uncle Claudius, who has murdered Hamlet's father, the King, and then taken 
      the throne and married Gertrude, Hamlet's mother. The play vividly charts the course of real and feigned
      madness—from overwhelming grief to seething rage—and explores themes of treachery, revenge, incest, and 
      moral corruption.

Product.create!(title: 'The Odyssey by Homer',
  description: 
    %{<p>
      The Odyssey is one of two major ancient Greek epic poems attributed to Homer. It is, in part, a sequel 
      to the Iliad, the other work traditionally ascribed to Homer. The poem is fundamental to the modern 
      Western canon. Indeed it is the second—the Iliad being the first—extant work of Western literature. 
      It was probably composed near the end of the eighth century BC, somewhere in Ionia, the Greek-speaking 
      coastal region of what is now Turkey. The poem mainly centers on the Greek hero Odysseus (or Ulysses, as
      he was known in Roman myths) and his long journey home following the fall of Troy. It takes Odysseus ten
      years to reach Ithaca after the ten-year Trojan War. In his absence, it is assumed he has died, and his
      wife Penelope and son Telemachus must deal with a group of unruly suitors, the Mnesteres or Proci,
      competing for Penelope's hand in marriage.

Product.create!(title: 'The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald',
  description: 
    %{<p>
      The novel chronicles an era that Fitzgerald himself dubbed the "Jazz Age". Following the shock and chaos
      of World War I, American society enjoyed unprecedented levels of prosperity during the "roaring" 1920s 
      as the economy soared. At the same time, Prohibition, the ban on the sale and manufacture of alcohol as 
      mandated by the Eighteenth Amendment, made millionaires out of bootleggers and led to an increase in 
      organized crime, for example the Jewish mafia. Although Fitzgerald, like Nick Carraway in his novel, 
      idolized the riches and glamor of the age, he was uncomfortable with the unrestrained materialism and 
      the lack of morality that went with it, a kind of decadence.

Product.create!(title: 'Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert',
  description: 
    %{<p>
      For daring to peer into the heart of an adulteress and enumerate its contents with profound dispassion,
      the author of Madame Bovary was tried for "offenses against morality and religion." What shocks us today 
      about Flaubert's devastatingly realized tale of a young woman destroyed by the reckless pursuit of her 
      romantic dreams is its pure artistry: the poise of its narrative structure, the opulence of its prose 
      (marvelously captured in the English translation of Francis Steegmuller), and its creation of a world 
      whose minor figures are as vital as its doomed heroine. In reading Madame Bovary, one experiences a work
      that remains genuinely revolutionary almost a century and a half after its creation.
